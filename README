# Eggdrop Puppet notificator plugin #
#####################################

This is my first TCL script, so be careful using it ;) Basically it just uses some unix common tools (find, diff) to scan your Puppet reports directory, than sends a message through your Eggdrop bot to notify you if a Puppet node has been missing for more than $delayinminutes.

Of course, you need to have both Puppet Master and Eggdrop running on the same machine ;)

To use this, edit puppet.tlc according to your local system config, than copy it into your plugin directory:

# cp puppet.tcl /usr/share/eggdrop/scripts

then, edit your eggdrop.conf file:
# cat "source /usr/share/eggdrop/scripts/puppet.tcl" >> /path/to/your/eggdrop.conf

end restart eggdrop bot

Tested with Eggdrop v1.6.19 and Puppet v2.6.2
